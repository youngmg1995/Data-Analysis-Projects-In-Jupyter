## Description
In this repository we have several data anlysis projects used to practice our skills with the pandas Python library for data science. For each project we use the functionalities included with pandas and the flexibility of jupyter notebooks to load large datasets, parse and cleanse each dataset, and analyse the datasets to make insightful conclusions. These projects are meant to replicate the scenarios a data analyst/scientist might encounter on the job when scoping out or developing initial solutions to a project. All datasets used for these projects are free and available on the web.

## Projects
1) **App Data Project:** Scoping potentially profitable apps for our company to develop by analysing data from Google Play and the App Store. 
2) **Hacker News Project:** Analysing user traffic and interactions by post type on Hacker News, a website similar to Reddit where users submit posts/stories related to technology. In doing so, determine which posts capture the attention of Hacker News' audience, what variables affect this, and possibly suggest new post types.
3) **eBay Kleinanzeigen Data Cleaning Project:** Cleansing raw data scraped from eBay Kleinanzeigen, an autos classifieds section of the German eBay website. In doing so, immensely improve the integrity of our data and also perform some simple analysis to devise a set of rules for optimizing auto trading activities on the website.
