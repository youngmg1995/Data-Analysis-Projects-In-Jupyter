We work for a company that develops apps for the Android and iOS markets, specifically free to download apps. Being free to download, the profitability of our apps is entirely dependant on the ad revenue generated by consumer usage. So more popular and highly rated apps will produce more revenue. Our job is to research past apps with these qualities and help our team make data driven decisions on the types of apps to develop in the future."

The average number of reviews for the game is genre is ~23K, only a quarter of the average reviews for the top genre *Navigation*.\n",

This leads me to believe that it may be better, or at least safer, to develop apps in the less popular genres. These niche areas of the App Store market will provide an opportunity for our company to develop an app with little opposition and a guarenteed likelihood of user activity. The primary candidate genres for this strategy would be *Navigation* and *Reference*, but could also include *Book* and *Weather*. To make sure these categories are actually popular in general and the mean isn't being skewed by outliers, below we will make histograms for the distribution of reviews in each genre."

    "Judging from the histograms we see that the distributions for all of the genres reviews are skewed, which is the case for all the apps in general. It would seem the means are elevated for each of these potentially niche genres because of one or two outliers in each case with many times more reviews than the rest of the sample. This would suggest that developing apps in each of these categories might not be as profitable as we concluded earlier. However, the *Book* and *Weather* genres looks to be slightly more promising than the *Navigation* and *Reference* genres. These two are not as skewed as the rest, and have a decent amount of apps with higher user reviews than compared to the general distibution.\n",

    "First looking at the category frequencies, we see that the *Family* category is dominant at ~19%, roughly double the runner-up. However, none of the categories stand out quite like the *Games* genre did for the App Store. Moreover, where the apps on the App Store were more geared towards entertainment, the dominant categories for the Google Play market all center around practical use.\n",

    "The frequency table for the *Genres* field is a bit more confusing. While the breadth of values found in this field are more granular than the *Category* field, the more dominant ones are exactly the same. So, for simplicity sake, we will primarily focus on the insights gathered from the segmentation of the *Category* field and not read too much into each available sub-genre.\n",

    "Surprisingly, the genres that had the most reviews in the App Store are not the same as the categories with the most reviews on Google Play. For the App Store, the top 5 genres consisted of *Navigation*, *Reference*, *Social Networking*, *Music*, and *Weather*. The only one to reappear in the top 5 categories for the Google Play dataset was social networking, which could be akin to the *Social* and *Communication* categories. Given the social media apps are so popular on both platforms, we may recommend that our company develop these sorts of apps. We should mention to our team however that doing so will be very risky, as the distributions for these apps are very skewed. As seen in the histogram below, most social media apps do not garner much user activity. However, some apps attract a decent number of users and a few, such as Facebook and Instagram, pull in massive amounts of activity. So if our team is confident in their abilities to develop these apps, it may be worth while."

According to the Google Play dataset, apps in the *WEATHER* and *BOOK_AND_REFERENCE* categories have a sginificantly higher average number of reviews. Below are the distributions of reviews for these apps. Like is the case in general, the distributions are very skewed by outliers with many times more reveiws, but not to the extent of the social media apps."

    "While knowing which apps have the most reviews is important, and comparable to what we did for the App Store genres, we actually have more specific information regarding user activity for the Google Play apps. Recall that one of the columns in our dataset is the number of installs for each app on the market place. This is much more important than the number of reviews, becuase users often dowload and spend time on apps without leaving reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since this field correlates more so with user activity, it will be valuable in identifying the popular app genres. We should note however that this field is not entirely accurate. The values listed are not specific numbers of downloads, but rather qualitative ranges such as 1000+, 50,000+, 10,000,000+, etc.. Exact figures are preferred, but for our purposes this will do just find. We do not need 100% accuracy and these ranges should still give us a good idea of which apps have more activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we write a function that converts these qualitative ranges into number values that can be used for calculations. For simplicity, and to err on the conservative side, we will just take the minimum values of each range. For example, '1,000+' would be converted to the number 1000, '50,000' to 50000, and so on. The function below takes as an input an string representing one of these qualitative ranges and returns the converted numerical value."

However, like we said before, we have reason to believe that these averages are being skewed heavily by a few very popular apps and that the markets are fairly competitive for these genres. It would still seem as if one of the more niche categories, either weather, books, or references, are the most promising. Just as one last double check, below are bar graphs of these categories and the frequency of app installs by range."

    "Comparing each of the distributions to the total, we see that the weather category is much more favorable. The books and reference category is fairly evenly distributed, but unfortunately centered at a lower installs bin range. On the other hand, weather category is centered at the 1,000,000+ installs bin range, which is even with if not more than the approximate center for all the apps. Furthermore, the average for this category is actually skewed down by a few apps in the lower ranges, such as 10+, 500+, etc.. Overall, this confirms that the weather category is the most promising app genre for development in the Google Play market thanks to a combination of low competition and popular demand for the few apps out there.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we have cleansed and analysed two sets of data regarding mobile apps available on the App Store and Google Play markets. To cleanse our data we removed incorrect data, duplicate records, non-English apps, and non free to dowload apps. Once our data was cleaned we began segmenting our data by genre with the aim of identifying those that are more popular and well received in each marketplace. Our goal in doing so was to find the types of apps that would be best for our company to market themselves. Using the frequency of genres, number of reviews, and number of installs, we were able to identify a few app categories in each dataset that have a history of low competition and high user activity. However, there was only one category that pasted all our requirements in both marketplaces, and this was the *Weather* genre. Based on our analysis, our company can take advantage of this niche area which experiences low saturation of apps yet relatively high demand for the ones that exist. Developing an app in this category is likely to drive consistent user activity and ad revenue as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "If our company wishes to take a more bold approach, however, in the hopes of more profit, we might suggest developing a social media app. Across the board these apps have the potential for attracting the most users, on average and in the extreme cases, so this is the genre to be in for higher profits. However, this approach should be considered catiously as there is more risk involved. This category experiences more competition, though not as high as others (Ex. games), and many of the apps have little to no user activity."
